Feature: Preview a page
  As an author
  I want to preview the page I'm editing in the CMS
  So that I can see how it would look like to my visitors

  Scenario: I can show a preview of the current page from the pages section
  Given I am logged into the CMS
  And I open the "About Us" page
  And I click the "Preview Â»" link
  Then I can see the "preview" panel
  And the preview contains "About Us"

  Scenario: I can see an updated preview when editing content
  Given I am logged into the CMS
	And I open the "About Us" page
	# TODO Only tests correctly on fresh database
	When I put "my new content" into the "Content" field
  And I save the page
	And I open the preview
  Then I can see the content "You can fill"
#  Then I cannot see the content "my new content"
#  When I click the "Draft Site" link
#  Then I can see the content "my new content"
  And I close the preview
  Then I can see a "Content" field
